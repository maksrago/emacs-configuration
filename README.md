# Maksymilian M. Rago Emacs Configuration

#Preface
This repository contains a series of various files that I use in order to organize and intialize my Emacs configuration. If you have any specific questions regarding how something works, or why I use a specific package please send all inqueries to my personal email, maxrago123@gmail.com.

#.emacs
My .emacs file simply consists of the necessary components to pull code off of conf.org (this file contains all of my actual configuration).

#conf.org
This file organizes all of the components of my large (and continously growing) Emacs configuration. I decided to move over to this method of configuration management in an attempt to make updating various components easier after not viewing them for some time. Furthermore, I think it makes my configuration much easier to be read by others.

#Finally...
I understand how frustrating and overwhelming Emacs can be sometimes. So please, if you have any questions feel free to email me. A good resource for those who want to learn Emacs is, "Learning GNU Emacs," (Used copies can be found for under $5).
